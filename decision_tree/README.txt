This is a current test environment and program for generating decision trees given data from the database. 

****************** TO DO: UPDATE READ ME
****************** CHECK PROGRAM FILES FOR SPECIFIC TO DO LISTS

The files in this folder are as follows: 
 -- venv (dir): Python environment - holds all dependencies and modules used by python program. 
		Requirements: 
			+ Python 3.8.1
			+ MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE 
			+ MySQL Server 8.0
			+ Setup DB in MySQL Workbench: 
				> schema name: "test_schema", username: "test_user", and password: "test123"
				> run test.sql to create table 

		To run code using python environment: 
			1) run Windows PowerShell and navigate to python_decision_tree_test
			
			2) Next, run the following commands: 
				> python -m venv .\venv
				> venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
			
			// It this is successful you should see (venv) in front of your user // 

			3) use the following command to run python program: py <python program>.py

		To add new module in python environment: 
			1) run Windows PowerShell and navigate to python_decision_tree_test
			2) venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
			3) pip install <module> 
					or
			   python -m pip install <module>
		

-- decision_tree_test (png): Visual of decision tree generated by python code using test database

-- decision_tree_test_iris (png): Visual of decision tree generated by python code using iris database from sklearn

-- README (txt): Guide outlining the purposes and uses of the files in this folder.  

-- TreeGenerator.py (py): Python code that does the following: 
			> Connects to database via MySQL server
			> Parses data from database into train and test data
			> Generates decision trees that are trained using either Gini index or Entropy
			> Determines accuracy of decision trees based on tests performed using the two techniques

-- TrainingData.py (py): Python code that does the following: 
			> Connects to database via MySQL Server
			> Determines the classifications for audio samples
			> Translates audio samples into distinct classifying features using MFCC analysis
			> Inserts transformed data and its classifications into the database for future use

-- test.sql (sql): file containing SQL commands to construct database table
