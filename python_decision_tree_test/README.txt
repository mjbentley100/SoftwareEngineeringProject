This is a current test environment and program for generating decision trees given data from the database. 

The files in this folder are as follows: 
 -- venv (dir): Python environment - holds all dependencies and modules used by python program. 
		Requirements: 
			+ Python 3.8.1
			+ MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE 
			+ MySQL Server 8.0
			+ Setup DB in MySQL Workbench: 
				> schema name: "test_schema", username: "test_user", and password: "test123"
				> run test.sql to create table 

		To run code using python environment: 
			1) run Windows PowerShell and navigate to python_decision_tree_test
			2) run the following command: venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
			3) run the following command: py test.py

		To add new module in python environment: 
			1) run Windows PowerShell and navigate to python_decision_tree_test
			2) venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
			3) pip install <module>

-- decision_tree_test_iris (png): Visual of decision tree generated by python code using iris database from sklearn

-- README (txt): Guide outlining the purposes and uses of the files in this folder.  

-- test.py (py): Python test code that does the following: 
			> Connects to database via MySQL server
			> Parses data from database into train and test data
			> Generates decision trees that are trained using either Gini index or Entropy
			> Determines accuracy of decision trees based on tests performed using the two techniques

-- test.sql (sql): file containing SQL commands to construct database table
